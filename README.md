# A Brief Biography 
Hi! I'm Zhuoqing Li. I'm from Xinjiang, China. I graduated frome Peking University and my major is international political economy, but I'm not interesed in that field anymore. Instead of that, I have a strong passion for staying updated on the ever-changing market dynamics, the cutting-edge developments in AI, and how AI is revolutionizing the e-commerce industry. I believe that these areas hold immense potential for innovation and growth, and I aspire to leverage my skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact.
