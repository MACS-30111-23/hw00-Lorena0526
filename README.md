Edit this README file to include a brief biography of yourself. Your README should include the following elements:
* Headers (one or more)
* Emphasis (italics or/and bold)
* Lists
* Images: add a picture (of yourself or something else) to your repo and embed it in your README
* Links
* A summary and reflection of the Git/GitHub workflow you adopted for this homework, and of your experience with Markdown (e.g., provide a summary of the workflow you adopted, and add some comments about something new you learned, something that surprised you, etc.)

# A Brief Biography 
Hi! I'm Zhuoqing Li. I'm from Xinjiang, China. I graduated frome Peking University and my major is international political economy, but I'm not interesed in that field anymore. Instead of that, I have a strong passion for staying updated on the ever-changing market dynamics, the cutting-edge developments in AI, and how AI is revolutionizing the e-commerce industry. I believe that these areas hold immense potential for innovation and growth, and I aspire to leverage my skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact. 
## Basic Personal Information
* English Name: **Lorena**
* Pronouns: she/her/hers
## Interests and Hobbies
* Interests: For academics, I'm interested in **consumer behavior and psychology** during online shopping. 
* Hobbies: I love _rap music_, and I also like _playing tennis_. Although I have learned to play tennis for two years, I think I'm still a green young novice. Moreover,I enjoy **Citywalks and photography**. Chicago is not yet a very familiar city to me. Therefore, exploring this city brings me a lot of joy. The photo below was taken during my _Architecture River Tour_ in downtown. [Links to buy tickets if you're interested in the Architecture River Tour](https://shorelinesightseeing.com/)

# Learning Outcome
* A summary of the workflow: First, edit the README.md file and add required information to that file using basic writing and formatting syntax of github(Markdown).We could edit the file directly on the github or using other tools like VS Code. If just directly revising something on the github, after finishing the assignment, click "commit changes" button to commit the revised file to my GitHub repository. If using VS Code, we should commit changes and then push the changed file to the target GitHub repository.
* Markdown: I learn more basic writing and formatting syntax during finishing the code, especially how to add links and images to the README.md file. We can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). We can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in [ ]. Then, wrap the link for the image in parentheses (). Something that surprised me was that if I had uploaded images to my repo, I could use relative links to display an image.
